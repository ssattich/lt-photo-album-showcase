# Running lt-photo-album-showcase locally

1. Be sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) installed. You can run `npm -v` to check.
2. After checking out lt-photo-album-showcase, navigate to the project directory in the console of your choice.
3. Run `npm install` in the project directory. This might take a couple of minutes to finish.
4. Run **`npm start`** in the project directory.

**`npm start`** will run the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). A tab navigated to the app should automatically open in your default browser.

The page will reload if you make any changes to the app, and any lint errors will print to the console.

## Other available scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). As such, the following scripts are available to run in the project directory, in addition to **`npm start`**:

- **`npm test`**\
  Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- **`npm run build`**\
  Per React:

  > Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
  > It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
  >
  > The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
  > Your app is ready to be deployed!

- **`npm run eject`**\
  The odds of us wanting to run this one are slim. Per React:

  > **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
  >
  > If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
  >
  > Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
  >
  > You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
